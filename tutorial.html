        <h2>How to Play Checkers</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or block them so they cannot move.</li>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> The game is played on an 8x8 board. Each player starts with 12 pieces placed on the dark squares of the three rows closest to them.</li>
            <li><strong>Moving Pieces:</strong> Players take turns moving one piece. Pieces can only move diagonally forward to an adjacent unoccupied square.</li>
            <li><strong>Capturing:</strong> If an opponent's piece is adjacent to yours and the square beyond it is empty, you can jump over the opponent's piece and capture it.</li>
            <li><strong>Becoming a King:</strong> When a piece reaches the opponent's back row, it is crowned and becomes a king, allowing it to move both forward and backward.</li>
            <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces or blocks them from making a legal move.</li>
